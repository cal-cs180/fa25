    <h1>How to submit assignments for CS180/CS280A.</h1>
  </header>
  <p>
    For each assignment, you will be required to submit two deliverables to
    Gradescope and share your website link via Google Form to showcase your work alongside your classmates. <br>
    Please upload a <code>.zip</code> adhering to the following structure:
  </p>
  <code>
    submission.zip<br />
    ├─code/<br />
    │ ├─main.ipynb &nbsp;&nbsp;<i># or main.py</i><br />
    │ ├─utils.py&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i># generic example file, not needed</i><br />
    │ └─README.txt&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i># or markdown</i><br />
    └─web/<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;└─page.pdf <br />
    <!-- &nbsp;&nbsp;└─sites.txt <br /> -->
  </code>

  <br>
  <h2>1. Code</h2>
  <p>
    You should upload code <i>only</i> to Gradescope. <b>Do <i>not</i> host your code publicly.</b>
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      All of your project code should be contained in some
      <code>main.py</code> or <code>main.ipynb</code> that the grader / we can run to reproduce your
      results. If you have a complex workflow, try to simplify it first, and then make sure to upload all the necessary files and include a
      <code>README.txt</code> file describing how we can run your code.
    </li>
    <li>
      (If applicable) please be sure to appropriately comment your code so that the graders can appropriately identify where your
      implementations lie and what they do.
    </li>
    <li>
      Place all of your coding files in the <code>code/</code> directory. They should be distinct from your web files.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <br>
  <h2>2. Webpage Report</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      You should upload a <code>web/</code> folder contains <code>page.pdf</code>.
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>page.pdf</code> should be a PDF of your webpage (i.e. printing the page and saving it as a PDF). If you do not already have a webpage set up, we recommend using GitHub Pages (<a
      href="./gh-pages.html">tutorial</a>).
      <ul>
        <li>
          Print your webpage as a PDF <u>with the URL in the header/footer</u> (see image below for the "Headers and footers" option). This allows us to go see your original webpage with your fancy animations
          <br><img src="assets/pdf_header_option.jpg" alt="PDF print settings showing Headers and footers option" style="max-width: 300px; margin: 10px 0;">
        </li>
      </ul>
    <li>
      It's your responsibility to ensure that if your page contains animations or interactivity (which cannot be captured in a PDF), this is clearly communicated, for example, by noting it in the PDF.
    </li>
    <li>You may consider compressing the PDF
      file if you hit the 100Mb size limit
      (e.g. with <a href="https://www.adobe.com/acrobat/online/compress-pdf.html">this</a>)</li>
    </li>
    <!-- <li>
      <code>sites.txt</code> should be a have two lines (and nothing else!):
    </li> -->
  </ul>
  <p>
    If you have any comments, even if they're about web and not code, please include them in <code>./code/README.txt</code>
  </p>

  <br>
  <h2>3. Google Form</h2>
  <p>
    Share your website link through the Google Form (for each project) to showcase your project alongside your classmates' work! This creates a public gallery where everyone can explore each other's projects. The form link will be posted on each respective project page.
